Matchmaking

when you join matchmaking, the user of the page is added into a list.
when the list is populated with size 2 or more, create a game object (and add it to a list of games), with a currently unique key, and assign the users the game key 
(meaning a value attached to their account?) (in that case you have to prevent a player from being in multiple games)
when sent to the game page, pass the assigned key into the decision function, so that it will send the information to the right game object.

e.g.

Game (key, rounds){
gamekey;
p1choice; (NULL, TRUE, FALSE) : (Undecided, Heads, Tails)
p2choice; ...
p1score; #
p2score; #
roundstowin; < rounds (check score against this after round end to see if the match is over)


currentOutcome = ;

}
